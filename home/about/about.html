    <p> Welcome! Where Wordsearch Meets Innovation and Community! <br>
        We are The Gorns which consist of 5 team members, Ethan Reed, Cruz Lopez, Cameron Chalupa, Zoe Becker, and Melanie Garza. 
        We believe that the joy of word searching should be limitless, engaging, and always exciting. Born from a love for puzzles 
        and a desire to innovate, our team came together to create a wordsearch experience unlike any other. The idea sparked when we realized that 
        while traditional wordsearch games are fun, there's a whole world of possibilities yet to be explored. Why limit ourselves to standard grids 
        when we could dive into themes, different grid shapes, and a multiplayer user experience? That's when our wordsearch was born â€“ a platform 
        where the classic wordsearch game meets modern creativity and technology. We invite you to join us in this exciting wordsearch adventure. 
        Challenge your friends, explore our themed puzzles, and enjoy the unique twists we've brought to the classic wordsearch game. 
        We can't wait to see how you'll dive into the world of words. <br>

        Happy Puzzle Solving! <br>

        The Gorns
